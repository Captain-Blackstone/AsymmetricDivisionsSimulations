# For 1000 bins
# A = 690 -> generation time with phi = 1 equals to 1 time step
# B -> fraction of cells that die per generation, between 0 and 1
# C -> fraction of the food in chemostat that 1 cell eats during one generation.
# D -> fraction of lethal damage that is accumulated by cell per generation
# E -> ? on the scale of D, i guess...
# F -> % increase of damage concentration per generation
# G -> just shape, man
